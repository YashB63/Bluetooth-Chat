# Bluetooth-Chat
Chatting using Bluetooth refers to the process of exchanging text messages or other types of data between two Bluetooth-enabled devices. Bluetooth is a short-range wireless technology that allows devices to communicate with each other over a distance of up to approximately 30 feet (10 meters). 
To chat using Bluetooth, both devices must have Bluetooth enabled and paired with each other. Once the devices are paired, users can use a chat app or any other messaging app that supports Bluetooth to send and receive messages. The process is similar to chatting over a messaging app that uses an internet connection, except that the data is transmitted over Bluetooth instead of the internet.
